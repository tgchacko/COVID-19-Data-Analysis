# COVID-19-Data-Analysis with Python

The objective of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 dataset to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models to forecast the number of confirmed cases. This analysis aims to help understand the spread of the virus and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Data Description
The dataset `covid_19_clean_complete.csv` contains various columns including:
- **Date**: The date of the observation.
- **Country/Region**: The country or region of the observation.
- **Confirmed**: The number of confirmed cases.
- **Deaths**: The number of deaths.
- **Recovered**: The number of recoveries.

## EDA Steps:

1) Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
2) Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.
3) Visualization: Create plots to visualize trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.

## Findings:

1) Trend Analysis: Observations on how the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries have evolved over time.
2) Impact of Interventions: Analysis of how lockdowns and other interventions have affected the spread of the virus.
3) Regional Differences: Insights into how the pandemic has impacted different regions differently.

## Conclusion:

The analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's progression and the effectiveness of various interventions.
