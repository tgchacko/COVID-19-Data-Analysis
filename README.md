# COVID-19-Data-Analysis with Python

The objective of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 dataset to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models to forecast the number of confirmed cases. This analysis aims to help understand the spread of the virus and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

EDA Steps:

1) Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
2) Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.
3) Visualization: Create plots to visualize trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.
4) Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between different variables such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and external factors.
